## Course Duration
8 Weeks (2 sessions per week, 2 hours each)

## Week 1: Introduction to AI and Scratch Basics
### Session 1:
What is AI? - Basic concepts and applications (English & Chinese)
Introduction to Scratch: Interface and basic blocks
Practice: Create a simple sequence of movements in Scratch.
### Session 2:
Understanding the 6-Axis Robot Arm: Components, movements, and safety.
Connecting Scratch with the robot arm (hardware setup overview).
Practice: Control a virtual robot arm in Scratch to understand basic commands.

## Week 2: Programming Movement with Scratch
### Session 1:
Programming basic movements: Move, rotate, and stop.
Understanding coordinates and angles in 3D space.
Practice: Program the robot arm to perform simple pick-and-place tasks.

### Session 2:
Complex movements: Demonstrating poses with multiple axes.
Introduction to loops and conditions in Scratch for precise control.
Practice: Create a sequence of poses for the robot arm.

## Week 3: AI Concepts in Motion
### Session 1:
AI in Robotics: Sensing and Decision Making.
How Scratch can simulate AI behavior (e.g., pathfinding).
Practice: Implement a simple AI behavior where the arm reacts to different inputs.

### Session 2:
Exploring AI algorithms like decision trees with Scratch.
Teaching the arm to differentiate between objects (basic image recognition).
Practice: Program the arm to choose different poses based on detected shapes.

## Week 4: Enhancing Interaction
### Session 1:
User Interaction: Controlling the arm with Scratch's input blocks.
Basics of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).
Practice: Create an interactive session where users control the arm's pose.

### Session 2:
Feedback Loops: Making the robot arm adjust based on user feedback.
Practice: Implement a feedback mechanism where the arm corrects its pose.

## Week 5: Practical Applications and Fun Projects
### Session 1:
Project 1: Mini Art Gallery - Have the arm display different artworks.
Practice: Program the arm to mimic painting poses or hold different art pieces.

### Session 2:
Project 2: Dance Moves - Teaching the robot arm to "dance" through poses.
Practice: Create a dance sequence with varying speeds and movements.

## Week 6: AI Optimization and Challenges
### Session 1:
Optimizing movements for efficiency and precision.
Understanding AI's role in optimizing robotic tasks.
Practice: Refine the previously created poses for smoothness and accuracy.

### Session 2:
Challenges: Obstacle avoidance and path planning.
Practice: Program the arm to navigate around obstacles while maintaining poses.

## Week 7: Advanced Scratch Techniques for AI
### Session 1:
Using Scratch for complex AI algorithms: Pattern recognition.
Practice: Develop a project where the arm recognizes and sorts objects.

### Session 2:
Collaborative Projects: Work in pairs or groups to design a more complex AI-driven task.
Practice: Group project where teams create an interactive exhibit using the arm.

## Week 8: Review and Showcase
### Session 1:
Review of AI concepts learned and their applications in Scratch.
Preparation for final project presentations.
Practice: Final touch-ups on individual or group projects.

### Session 2:
Project Showcase: Students present their AI-controlled robot arm projects.
Feedback session and discussion on future AI learning paths.
Practice: Live demonstration and Q&A session.
